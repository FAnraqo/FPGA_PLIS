I love you, though I rage at it,Though it is shame and toil misguided,And to my folly self-deridedHere at your feet I will admit!It ill befits my years, my station,Good sense has long been overdue!And yet, by every indicationLove’s plague has stricken me anew:You’re out of sight — I fall to yawning;You’re here — I suffer and feel blue,And barely keep myself from owning,Dear elf, how much I care for you!Why, when your guileless girlish chatterDrifts from next door your airy tread,Your rustling dress, my senses scatterAnd I completely lose my head.You smile — I flush with exultation;You turn away- I’m plunged in gloom,Your pallid hand is compensationFor a whole day of fancied doom.When to the frame with artless motionYou bend to cross-stitch, all devotion,Your eyes and ringlets down-beguiled,My heart goes out in mute emotion,Rejoicing in you like a child!Dare I confess to you my sighing,How jealously I chafe and balkWhen you set forth, defyingBad weather, on a lengthy walk?And then your solitary crying,Those twosome whispers out of sight,Your carriage to Opochka plying,And the piano late at night…Aline! I ask but to be pitied,I do not dare to plead for love;Love, for the sins I have committed,I am perhaps unworthy of.But make believe! Your gaze, dear elf,Is fit to conjure with, believe me!Ah, it is easy to deceive me!…I long to be deceived myself!.
